### **Project Title:**  
**Automated Deletion of Stale EBS Snapshots using AWS Lambda**

### **Problem Statement:**  
In cloud environments, **EBS snapshots** are often used to back up EC2 instance volumes. However, there are scenarios where **EC2 instances are deleted**, but the associated **volumes and snapshots are not**. This can lead to unnecessary storage costs for unused snapshots.  
- **Case 1:** A DevOps engineer deletes an EC2 instance but forgets to delete the **associated EBS volume** and **snapshots**.  
- **Case 2:** An engineer deletes the EC2 instance and volume but **forgets to delete the snapshots**, leaving behind **useless snapshots** that incur costs.  

In both cases, these **unused snapshots** take up unnecessary storage space, resulting in extra charges. The goal of this project is to create a **Lambda function** that automatically detects and deletes these **stale snapshots** after a certain period, reducing unnecessary storage costs.

---

### **Problem It Solves:**  
This project addresses the issue of **unused and stale snapshots** that accumulate after an EC2 instance and its volume are deleted. If these snapshots are not deleted, they continue to consume storage, leading to unnecessary charges. The Lambda function **automates the process of identifying and deleting stale snapshots**, thus saving on **storage costs** and **optimizing cloud resource management**.

---

### **Solution and Approach:**  
We'll create a Lambda function in Python that performs the following tasks:  
1. **Fetch All EBS Snapshots:** The Lambda function will query all snapshots in the account using the **AWS Boto3 SDK**.
2. **Filter Stale Snapshots:** It will then check if each snapshot is still associated with an active EC2 instance. If the snapshot‚Äôs volume is no longer attached to any running or stopped EC2 instance, it's considered **stale**.
3. **Delete Stale Snapshots:** If a snapshot has been unused for over 6 months (or any custom buffer time), the function will delete it to free up storage and reduce costs.
   
The Lambda function will:
- Retrieve snapshots using **EC2 API**.
- Check if the snapshots are associated with any active or stopped instances using **EC2 volume attachments**.
- Delete any snapshot that is **older than 6 months** and **not in use**.

---

### **Detailed Workflow of the Lambda Function:**
1. **Query all snapshots** in the account:
   - Use the `describe_snapshots()` method from the Boto3 SDK to get a list of all snapshots in the account.
2. **Get active EC2 instances and their volumes**:
   - Use `describe_instances()` to get a list of all running and stopped EC2 instances and their volumes.
3. **Check snapshot association**:
   - For each snapshot, check if its associated volume is still in use by an EC2 instance.
4. **Calculate snapshot age**:
   - Check the **snapshot creation date** and compare it with the current date. If it's older than 6 months (buffer time), it will be flagged for deletion.
5. **Delete stale snapshots**:
   - If the snapshot is stale and older than the defined buffer period, call `delete_snapshot()` to remove it.

### **Why This Is Important (for the Interview):**
- **Cost Optimization:** This solution helps avoid unnecessary storage costs by **automatically cleaning up stale snapshots** that are not being used.
- **Automation:** The Lambda function removes the need for manual intervention, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
- **Scalability:** Lambda scales automatically and can handle multiple snapshots efficiently without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- **Real-world Application:** This type of automation can be applied in production environments, where multiple EC2 instances are frequently created and deleted, ensuring resources are cleaned up without human oversight.

---

### **Example Use Case:**  
Let‚Äôs say a team has launched multiple EC2 instances for a project, and after the project ends, some instances are deleted. However, the EBS snapshots created during that time are still there, and no one remembers to delete them. The Lambda function will automatically check for these unused snapshots and **delete them** after 6 months, saving the team from unnecessary AWS storage costs.

This project shows how automation can be applied to everyday cloud management tasks, **improving efficiency and reducing manual mistakes** in the process.

### **AWS Cost Optimization**  

AWS cost optimization is all about **reducing unnecessary cloud costs** while keeping your applications running smoothly. Many companies **overspend** on AWS by **running unused resources, using oversized instances, or not choosing the right pricing model**. Cost optimization helps businesses **save money while maintaining performance**.  

---

### **Why Do We Need AWS Cost Optimization? (Problem It Solves)**
üí∞ **Unnecessary Costs:** Paying for resources that are not in use (e.g., running EC2 instances 24/7 even when they‚Äôre only needed for 8 hours).  
üìè **Over-Provisioning:** Using large instance types (e.g., EC2, RDS) when a smaller one would work just fine.  
üìâ **No Auto-Scaling:** Paying for extra capacity even during low traffic periods instead of automatically adjusting resources.  
üîÑ **Wrong Pricing Model:** Using **On-Demand pricing** for long-term workloads instead of cheaper options like **Reserved Instances** or **Spot Instances**.  

---

### **How to Optimize AWS Costs?**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Use Auto-Scaling** ‚Äì Automatically add/remove instances based on traffic.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Right-Size Resources** ‚Äì Choose instance sizes based on actual usage.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Use Reserved & Spot Instances** ‚Äì Get discounts for long-term use or buy unused capacity at lower prices.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Turn Off Unused Resources** ‚Äì Schedule EC2 instances to stop when not needed.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimize Storage Costs** ‚Äì Move infrequently used data to cheaper S3 storage tiers like **Glacier**.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Monitor with AWS Cost Explorer** ‚Äì Track and analyze where you‚Äôre spending the most.

### **Example: Saving Money on EC2 Instances**
Imagine you have **10 EC2 instances** running **24/7** for a workload that is only used during business hours (**9 AM - 6 PM**).  
- **Before Optimization:** You‚Äôre paying for 24 hours a day, even though the workload is only used for 9 hours.  
- **After Optimization:** By using **AWS Auto Scaling or scheduling instances to stop after work hours**, you reduce costs by nearly **60%**.  

‚úÖ **Outcome:** You still get the same performance, but now you're paying for **only the hours you need** instead of wasting money!  

By following these cost-saving strategies, companies **cut cloud expenses while keeping their applications efficient**. üöÄ

AWS Lambda is a highly versatile, serverless compute service that allows you to run code in response to various triggers without managing servers. It supports a wide range of activities and use cases. Here are some common activities you can perform using AWS Lambda:
